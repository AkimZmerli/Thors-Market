# Backround

Thanks to TORs Flexbox project I now have all the nessecary tools at my disposal to create my very first website using only HTML and CSS from scratch.

# What I have learned

Altough TOP offered styling suggestions and helpful advice on how to ask for help, I found myself bewildered by the sheer mass of details that needed to be put in place.
The first days I did a little work in the header, then right in the footer and then the body was left out. So the script looked awefully chaotic. 

After midway throught the project I got stuck on how to form the four squares and put the text beneath in place. However TOP pointed me in the right direction when there were questions to be placed. A blog post helped me significantly and soon after my web site was looking more and more like I have imagined. 

I felt relieve and joy seeing the end results of the project. This journey has tought me to stay on track, never to give up and always ask for help.
